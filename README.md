SCRIPTS
============

****
fortunevoice:

A very very stupid script to generate voice synthesized fortunes. requires fortune-mod and festival.


In the spirit of fun (and because this is a worthless script with no real value) the -o switch 
is used when generating our fortunes. If this offends you please remove the -o switch before 
running this script!!!

For more offensive fortunes please install fortunes-off in addition to fortune-mod

Note: this script is using a very hack-ish method to remove characters from fortunes that will 
otherwise interfere with the function of festival. This may have unintended consequenses with 
performance of this script.
